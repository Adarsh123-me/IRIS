# IRIS





->

Let's develop a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into their respective species using the Iris dataset. We'll use the scikit-learn library for this task. The steps involved are:

#Load the Data: Load the Iris dataset.

#Explore the Data: Examine the dataset to understand its structure and contents.

#Preprocess the Data: Clean the data if necessary and split it into training and testing sets.

#Model Building: Train a machine learning model using the training set.

#Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using the testing set.
